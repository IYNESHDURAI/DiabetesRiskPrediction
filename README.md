# DiabetesRiskPrediction
A machine learning project to predict diabetes risk based on patient data, enabling early detection and proactive healthcare management.

## Project Overview
The increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide poses a significant public health challenge. Early detection and proactive management of diabetes are crucial in preventing complications and improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on specific features. The model assists healthcare providers in making timely interventions and implementing personalized strategies for diabetes prevention, ultimately enhancing proactive healthcare measures, reducing the burden of diabetes-related complications, and improving overall public health outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises crucial sign and symptom data of individuals who either exhibit early signs of diabetes or are at risk of developing diabetes. It can be downloaded from the following link: Diabetes Risk Dataset.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:

## Part 1: Data Exploration and Model Building
Import Libraries/Dataset

Conducting and visualizing correlational analysis.
Data Pre-processing and Cleaning
Identifying and handling NULL or Missing Values.
Detecting and handling outliers.
Transforming data using Standardization and Normalization.
Conducting feature engineering and identifying feature importance.
Model Building
Splitting the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.
Building models using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
Tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation.
Performance Evaluation
Comparing Logistic Regression and Decision Tree using evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-score.

## Part 2: Advanced Model Building and Hyperparameter Tuning
Model Building
Building models using K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayesian, Random Forest, and Adaboost.
Performance Evaluation
